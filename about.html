<h2 style="color:white";>Sensory Integration Dysfunction</h2></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white";>Sensory Integration Dysfunction is part of the key symptoms associated with Autism, and ADHD. We are different neurobiologically, and due to the different wiring of our nervous systems and neural networks, we are susceptible to being overwhelmed by sensory inputs. The sensory channels include:</p></center>

<center>
<ul style="color:white";>

<li>Vestibular (Balance and Movement - Gross Motor/Kinetics)</li>
<li>Proprioceptive (Sense of Body in Space - Spatial awareness, fine motor integration)</li>
<li>Tactile (Touch)</li>
<li>Olfactory (Sense of Smell)</li>
<li>Gustatory (Taste)</li>
<li>Auditory (Hearing)</li>
<li>Visual (Sight)</li>
<li>Enteric Nervous System (instinct)</li>
</ul>
<center><p style="color:white";>
The enteric nervous system has been recently discovered: neurons are located within the digestive system, and this could possibility be the cause of many episodes of irritable bowel disorder associated with chronic anxiety, particularly for autistics. Anxiety can cause many immune system flare ups and problems with the digestive system, and the discovery of the enteric nervous system helps explain why we "feel" things in our stomach, like butterflies when we have anxiety and panic attacks.</p></center>
<center><p style="color:white";>
Autistics and people with AD/HD are completely different with wiring and neurobiological structures. Imaging studies and autopsies on the brain of autistic people have shown clear delineations in the structures of both nervous systems and the brain of autistics and neurotypicals. Different areas of the brain are literally wired differently. It is often difficult to explain to neurotypical people that you, as either a person with AD/HD or Autism are markedly different and exhibit all of the issues associated with having sensory integration dysfunction, but the existence of this app can help you to explain to people why you need to take some time out to go and soothe your nervous system.</p></center>
